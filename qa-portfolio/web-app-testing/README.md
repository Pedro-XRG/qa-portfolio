This project evaluates the core functionality of the Trello Web Application using manual testing techniques.
The objective is to demonstrate my ability to design test cases, perform exploratory testing, identify defects, and document them clearly.

Functional areas covered:

User authentication (login & signup)

Board creation and deletion

List creation

Card creation, editing, moving, and deletion

UI/UX consistency

Basic navigation and account settings

Non-functional considerations:

Usability

Input validation

Error handling

Basic performance observations
