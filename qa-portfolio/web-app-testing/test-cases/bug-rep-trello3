Title: List Does Not Refresh Automatically After Moving a Card


Severity: Low

Priority: Low


Description:
If the user is logged in and there's at least two lists within the same board, the list does not refresh automatically when the user moves a card to a different list. 


Steps to Reproduce:

- Open any board containing multiple lists
- Select a card in List A
- Drag and drop the card into List B
- Observe List A immediately after the card leaves it


Expected Result: List A should immediately refresh and remove the card from its view without requiring user action.

Actual Result: List A does not visually update after the card is moved — the UI keeps showing the card as if it were still inside the original list. The list only updates after the user performs a manual refresh (F5).


Reproducibility: Consistent- 100% of the times under the described circumstances.


Notes:

- Could be related to network latency
- No console errors observed
- Not functionally blocking, but causes momentary confusion
